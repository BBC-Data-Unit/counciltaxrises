In March 2019 we [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-47442652) that council tax bills in England would increase by an average of 4.5% from April, reaching more than £1,800 in some regions. The story was based on [research by CIPFA](https://www.cipfastats.net/news/newsstory.asp?content=17324).

We took the “area” Band D council tax for each local authority and sorted this into the order of highest to lowest.

The area tax includes any precepts such as fire and police. It is an average in areas that also have parish councils as the precept for the parish can vary.

We have also weighted the historic figures for inflation, which shows that due to the referendum requirement for those wanting to exceed a government cap on rises, council tax actually fell in real terms for a number of years this decade and rose in real terms only once councils started adding an additional precept for social care.
